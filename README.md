# Tasky-Task-Manager-

In this project I created three pages : 
I. MainPage (This is the first page through which you can interact & from where you can add the new task to the local storage)  
II. CompletePage (Where you can store the task that you completed or marked as completed in the MainPage)  
III. BinPage (Where all the deleted task stored which you deleted from the CompetePage & MainPage)
